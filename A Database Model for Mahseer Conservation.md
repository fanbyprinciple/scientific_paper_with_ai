A Database Model for Mahseer Conservation: A Multi-Stakeholder, Data-Driven Approach to Monitor and Support the Conservation of Mahseer Populations

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Mahseer, belonging to the genus Tor and Neolissochilus and other closely related genera, represent a group of iconic freshwater fish found across South and Southeast Asia. According to FishBase (Froese & Pauly, 2024), there are approximately 17 recognized species of mahseer, with India being a hotspot for diversity, hosting around 8 species, including the Golden Mahseer (Tor putitora), Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree), and the critically endangered Humpback Mahseer (Tor remadevii). These species are characterized by their large size, golden hue, and ecological importance as apex predators and indicators of river health.

1.2 Study Area: The Cauvery River System 
The Cauvery River, flowing through the biodiverse regions of Coorg and Bheemeshwari in Karnataka, represents one of India's most important freshwater systems. It supports rich biodiversity, including several endemic and threatened species (Dahanukar et al., 2021). For mahseer, the river provides critical habitats for spawning, feeding, and migration (Bhatt et al., 2021). The river's importance extends beyond its ecological value, serving as a lifeline for local communities through agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.

1.3 Conservation Context
Current conservation efforts face significant challenges due to:
- Habitat degradation from dams, deforestation, and agricultural runoff
- Overfishing through unregulated angling and commercial practices
- Pollution from industrial and domestic waste
- Climate change impacts on water flow and temperature regimes
- Fragmented data collection and monitoring systems

2. Literature Review
2.1 Species Status and Distribution
Recent studies indicate declining mahseer populations across their range, particularly in the Himalayan rivers, Western Ghats, and Cauvery River basin (Pinder et al., 2015). Population estimates remain imprecise due to limited systematic surveys and challenges in studying these fish in remote river systems.

2.2 Conservation Frameworks
Contemporary conservation approaches increasingly emphasize:
- Integration of citizen science platforms (e.g., iNaturalist)
- Use of historical archives and georeferenced repositories
- Application of machine learning for species mapping
- Implementation of community-based monitoring systems

2.3 Habitat Suitability Analysis
Current research highlights critical environmental parameters:
- Flow velocity requirements (0.3–0.7 m/s)
- Depth preferences (1–3 m for adults)
- Thermal thresholds (optimal: 18–22°C)
- Substrate composition and woody debris importance

3. Research Gaps Identified
3.1 Data Management
- Lack of standardized data collection protocols
- Limited integration of traditional ecological knowledge
- Insufficient real-time monitoring capabilities
- Fragmented stakeholder communication systems

3.2 Ecological Understanding
- Incomplete juvenile habitat requirements data
- Limited understanding of migration patterns
- Gaps in population genetics information
- Insufficient long-term monitoring data

3.3 Conservation Implementation
- Limited stakeholder coordination mechanisms
- Inadequate early warning systems for threats
- Gaps in policy implementation frameworks
- Insufficient community engagement tools
