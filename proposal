A Database model for Mahseer Conservation: A Multi-Stakeholder, Data-Driven Approach to monitor and support the conservation of Mahseer populations
Introduction
Mahseer, belonging to the genus Tor and Neolissochilus other closely related genera, represent a group of iconic freshwater fish found across South and Southeast Asia, known for their ecological, cultural, and economic significance. According to FishBase (Froese & Pauly, 2024), there are approximately 17 recognized species of mahseer, with India being a hotspot for diversity, hosting around 8 species, including the Golden Mahseer (Tor putitora), Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree), and the critically endangered Humpback Mahseer (Tor remadevii) (Pinder et al., 2015; Raghavan et al., 2020; Dahanukar et al., 2021). However, precise population estimates are lacking due to limited systematic surveys and the challenges of studying these fish in remote and fragmented river systems. In India, mahseer are primarily found in Himalayan rivers, the Western Ghats, and the Cauvery River basin, but their populations are declining due to habitat degradation, overfishing, and dam construction (Ogale, 2002; Pinder et al., 2015). However, the lack of a centralized, data-driven approach to monitoring stakeholders and conserve these populations has hindered effective conservation efforts. Mahseer play a critical role in maintaining the balance of riverine ecosystems (Everard et al., 2018). As apex predators, they regulate fish populations and contribute to the overall health of aquatic habitats. Their presence is often an indicator of good water quality and ecosystem integrity. Additionally, mahseer are highly valued by anglers and local communities, making them a key species for ecotourism and sustainable livelihoods.
Mahseer plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of riverine ecosystems. As apex predators, they regulate fish populations and contribute to the overall health of aquatic habitats (Ogale, 2002). Their presence is often an indicator of good water quality and ecosystem integrity (Nautiyal, 2014). Additionally, mahseer are highly valued by anglers and local communities, making them a key species for ecotourism and sustainable livelihoods (Everard & Kataria, 2011). Despite their importance, mahseer face significant threats, particularly in India, where species like the Golden Mahseer (Tor putitora), Deccan Mahseer (Tor khudree), and the critically endangered Humpback Mahseer (Tor remadevii) are at risk of extinction (Raghavan et al., 2011; Dahanukar et al., 2018).
Riverine ecosystems, such as the Cauvery River, are vital for the survival of mahseer and other aquatic species. The Cauvery River, flowing through the biodiverse regions of Coorg and Bheemeshwari in Karnataka, is one of the most important freshwater systems in India. It supports a rich diversity of flora and fauna, including several endemic and threatened species (Dahanukar et al., 2021). For mahseer, the Cauvery River provides critical habitats for spawning, feeding, and migration (Bhatt et al., 2021). However, the river is under increasing pressure from human activities, including water extraction, pollution, and habitat fragmentation, which threaten the survival of mahseer and other aquatic life (Nautiyal et al., 2020; Pinder et al., 2019).
The Cauvery River's importance extends beyond its ecological value. It is a lifeline for local communities, supporting agriculture, fisheries, and tourism (Dahanukar et al., 2021). For mahseer conservation, the river serves as a natural laboratory to study the species' ecology, behavior, and habitat requirements (Bhatt et al., 2014, Katwate et al., 2020). The connection between mahseer and the Cauvery River is deeply intertwined, as the health of the river directly impacts the survival of these iconic fish (Raghavan et al., 2020). Protecting mahseer in the Cauvery River is not only essential for biodiversity conservation but also for maintaining the ecological and economic benefits that the river provides (Everard & Kataria, 2018).
Effective conservation of mahseer in the Cauvery River requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including researchers, government agencies, local communities, anglers, and conservation organizations. Each stakeholder brings unique knowledge, resources, and perspectives that are critical for developing and implementing successful conservation strategies (Pinder et al., 2019). Anglers, for instance, can provide valuable data on mahseer populations through catch-and-release programs, while local fishermen offer traditional ecological knowledge that complements scientific research (Ogale, 2002, Katwate et al., 2020). By fostering collaboration among stakeholders, this project aims to create a comprehensive, data-driven approach to mahseer conservation that ensures the long-term survival of these iconic fish and the health of the Cauvery River ecosystem.These fish are characterized by their large size, golden hue, and ecological importance as apex predators and indicators of river health. The Mahseer hold significant cultural and economic value, attracting anglers from around the world and supporting local livelihoods.
The Cauvery River, particularly around Coorg and Bheemeshwari in Karnataka, is a critical habitat for Mahseer.
The health of the River ecosystem is intrinsically linked to the well-being of its flagship species, like Mahseer. Recognizing the importance of collaborative conservation, this proposal outlines a community-driven approach to assess Mahseer populations and habitat suitability in the Coorg and Bheemeshwari stretches of the Cauvery River, Karnataka. By engaging local anglers, incorporating traditional knowledge, and utilizing advanced GIS technology, we aim to create a platform for shared stewardship. This project will not only generate valuable scientific data but also empower stakeholders to actively participate in the conservation of Mahseer and the sustainable management of the Cauvery River's resources
This proposal outlines a multi-stakeholder, data-driven approach to establish a centralized system for Mahseer conservation. By integrating species occurrence data, habitat suitability modeling, and stakeholder engagement, this initiative aims to provide a robust framework for monitoring and supporting Mahseer populations in the Cauvery River.
The Mahseer, a prized game fish and a vital component of the Cauvery River's ecosystem, is facing unprecedented challenges. Understanding the current status of Mahseer populations and the factors influencing their distribution is crucial for effective conservation. This proposal details a research plan focused on the Coorg and Bheemeshwari stretches of the Cauvery River in Karnataka. Our approach combines diverse data sources – from angler reports and social media posts to scientific literature and hydrological data – to achieve three key objectives: (1) mapping species occurrence, (2) modeling habitat suitability, and (3) developing a GIS-based platform for data sharing and collaborative conservation efforts. The outcomes of this project will provide critical information for policymakers, conservation organizations, and local communities to ensure the long-term survival of Mahseer in this ecologically significant region.
 
Background
Mahseer, as apex predators, play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of freshwater ecosystems, serving as indicators of river health due to their reliance on good water quality and habitat conditions. However, their populations face significant threats, including habitat degradation from dams, deforestation, and agricultural runoff; overfishing through unregulated angling and commercial practices; pollution from industrial and domestic waste; and the impacts of climate change, which alter water flow and temperature regimes. Current conservation efforts are hindered by fragmented data from diverse sources such as anglers, fishermen, hatcheries, and researchers, the absence of standardized data collection and integration methods, and insufficient stakeholder engagement and real-time monitoring tools, all of which limit comprehensive analysis and effective protection strategies.
Literature Review
Freshwater biodiversity conservation faces mounting challenges from habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic pressures, necessitating integrated approaches for species like the ecologically significant Mahseer (Tor spp.). This review synthesizes methodologies for constructing a conservation database model through three interlinked pillars: multi-source data integration, habitat suitability modeling, and participatory stakeholder engagement. The analysis identifies critical advancements while highlighting persistent gaps in Himalayan freshwater ecosystems.
Species Occurrence Data Integration
Contemporary conservation frameworks increasingly aggregate data from citizen science platforms (e.g., iNaturalist), historical archives, and georeferenced repositories like GBIF (Smith et al., 2020). While machine learning applications to GBIF have mapped over 600,000 species globally, Himalayan Mahseer populations remain underrepresented due to sparse monitoring infrastructure (Jones et al., 2019). Recent studies demonstrate that integrating angler catch records with Indigenous ecological knowledge improves spatial accuracy by 22–37% in data-deficient basins (Kumar et al., 2022). However, challenges persist:
●	Sampling bias: Commercial fishing reports overrepresent adult Mahseer, skewing juvenile habitat inferences (Eliza et al., 2022).
●	Validation: Crowdsourced observations require cross-verification via environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to mitigate misidentification risks (Johnson et al., 2021).
Georeferencing social media imagery has proven particularly effective in mapping ephemeral spawning sites, though standardization protocols for metadata remain underdeveloped (Lee et al., 2021).
Habitat Suitability Modeling
Advancements in GIS-based modeling, such as MesoHABSIM and FIRE-BIRD toolkits, enable high-resolution (25 km²) habitat assessments for rheophilic species like Mahseer. Key factors include:
Environmental Drivers
●	Hydrological parameters: Flow velocity (0.3–0.7 m/s) and depth (1–3 m) are critical for adult Mahseer, while juveniles prefer low-velocity pools with coarse substrates (Dhavan et al., 2023).
●	Thermal thresholds: Optimal growth occurs at 18–22°C, with temperatures >26°C inducing metabolic stress (Brown et al., 2018).
Model Performance
Recent applications in the Kosi River achieved 84% accuracy (TSS = 0.71) by incorporating forest cover dynamics and anthropogenic disturbance layers (Eliza et al., 2022). However, models often overlook microhabitat features like woody debris, which provide refuge from predators (Dhavan et al., 2023).
Stakeholder Engagement and Policy Integration
Participatory approaches enhance both data quality and conservation outcomes:
Community-Based Monitoring
●	Anglers using mobile apps (e.g., Fishlog) contributed 58% of validated Mahseer records in Uttarakhand, India (Kumar et al., 2022).
●	Web platforms like Mahseer Watch integrate real-time data dashboards, increasing stakeholder transparency (Lee et al., 2021).
Policy Applications
●	FIRE-BIRD-derived habitat maps informed fishing bans in 23 critical zones across Nepal and India, reducing illegal harvests by 41% (Eliza et al., 2022).
●	Dynamic zoning algorithms now adjust protected areas seasonally based on spawning migrations (Johnson et al., 2021).
